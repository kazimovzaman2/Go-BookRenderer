Choose Your Own Adventure is (was?) a series of books intended for children where as you read you would occasionally be given options about how you want to proceed. For instance, you might read about a boy walking in a cave when he stumbles across a dark passage or a ladder leading to an upper level and the reader will be presented with two options like:

- Turn to page 44 to go up the ladder.
- Turn to page 87 to venture down the dark passage.
